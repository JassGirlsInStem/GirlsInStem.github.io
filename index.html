									<h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
									<p>n 2019, Girls in STEM was founded at Jean Augustine Secondary School with the mission to empower young women to join academic fields. While STEM is an expanding field, women make up a smaller percentage of workers compared to men, resulting in a significant gender imbalance. Recognizing the problem laid the groundwork for the rest of our efforts. Our organization's principal goal, in the form of various initiatives, became translating discussion and theory of these social injustices into tangible action and impassioned advocacy.

We believe the gender gap has become a self-perpetuating problem. Young girls see few women entering fields such as science, technology, engineering, and math, therefore they have fewer role models and examples to look up to. Mentorship and role models are critical for anyone seeking a degree, gaining skills, or obtaining a job; most young people have stories about meeting someone they admire and pursuing a career path because of them. We hope that through this programme that we can become role models for future girls in STEM.

The gender disparity in STEM disciplines is well-known, but few programmes have been launched; particularly for young women, at this crucial time when they are deciding career paths. We want to empower and inspire girls in high school by providing a variety of opportunities. We hope that through this program, not only will there be an increased awareness of women's potential in STEM, but also that girls will be able to recognize their own.!</p>
